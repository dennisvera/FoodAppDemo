## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwipeableTabBarController is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwipeableTabBarController"
```

### Manual

Drop the classes inside of SwipeableTabBarController/Classes into your project.

## Usage

If you don't need subclassing `UITabBarController` just set the `UITabBarController` on the Storyboard to be of type `SwipeableTabBarController`.

Otherwise, make a subclass of `SwipeableTabBarController`.

Example:

```swift
import SwipeableTabBarController

class TabBarController: SwipeableTabBarController {
    // Do all your subclassing as a regular UITabBarController.
}
```

### Animations

`SwipeableTabBarController` supports 3 different types of animations out of the box. Setting the desired animation is easy. On your `SwipeableTabBarController` subclass just do:

```swift
setSwipeAnimation(type: SwipeAnimationType.push)
```

If you are supporting just one type of animation call it on `viewDidLoad()` otherwise call it as you need to change the desired animation.

#### Side by Side (default)

<a href="url"><img src="./GIFs/SideBySideAnimation.gif" align= height="216" width="125" ></a>

The default animation is `SwipeAnimationType.sideBySide` where the newly selected tab will move in at the same speed the previous one moves out.

#### Overlap

<a href="url"><img src="./GIFs/OverlapAnimation.gif" height="216" width="125" ></a>

`SwipeAnimationType.overlap` the newly selected tab will move in to take the central place on top of the previous one which will hold it's position.

#### Push

<a href="url"><img src="./GIFs/PushAnimation.gif" height="216" width="125" ></a>

`SwipeAnimationType.push` follows iOS default push animation where the top view moves away while the bottom one slightly moves behind. In this case, the top view will be the previously selected tab view.

### Restricted Swipe

You can choose to restrict your swiping to perfect horizontal swipe or support diagonal movement as well. I recommend enabling horizontal swipe if you are not using any kind of scrollViews on your controllers.

Default value is ```false```

```swift
setDiagonalSwipe(enabled: true)
```

### Disable Interaction

Support for disabling/enabling the interactor, this can be used on a controller that uses horizontal scrollView or a Map (in the example).

Default value is ```true```

```swift
setTabBarSwipe(enabled: false)
``` 

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
